# Booking System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing hotel_id in booking request**
   - **Problem**: The booking page expected `hotelId` parameter but the rooms section was sending `hotel`
   - **Solution**: Updated `ImprovedHotelRoomsSection.tsx` to send `hotelId` instead of `hotel`

### 2. **Check-in/Check-out dates not being passed**
   - **Problem**: Parameters were named `checkin`/`checkout` instead of `checkIn`/`checkOut`
   - **Solution**: Standardized parameter names to `checkIn` and `checkOut`

### 3. **Price calculation not considering nights**
   - **Problem**: Total price was only calculating room price × quantity, not multiplying by number of nights
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added `calculateNights()` function to calculate the difference between check-in and check-out dates
     - Modified price calculation to multiply by nights: `price × quantity × nights`
     - Added `nights` parameter to URL and booking data

### 4. **Price not showing correctly in booking summary**
   - **Problem**: BookingSummary wasn't showing the total price with nights multiplied
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added `nights` prop to BookingSummary component
     - Display per-night price and total price with nights: `₮X × N nights = ₮Y`
     - Added visual date range display with nights indicator

### 5. **Unable to edit selected dates**
   - **Problem**: Dates were read-only in the booking page
   - **Solution**: 
     - Made check-in and check-out dates editable with date input fields
     - Added automatic recalculation of nights and total price when dates change
     - Updated room totals dynamically when dates are modified

### 6. **Missing hotel name in booking**
   - **Problem**: Hotel name wasn't being passed to booking page
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added `hotelName` prop to `ImprovedHotelRoomsSection`
     - Pass hotel name from `HotelPageContent` 
     - Include hotel name in booking URL parameters

### 7. **Room data structure incomplete**
   - **Problem**: Room data was missing price breakdown (per-night vs total)
   - **Solution**: Enhanced BookingRoom interface to include:
     - `price_per_night`: Base room price per night
     - `total_price`: Calculated total (price_per_night × room_count × nights)

## Data Flow

### Booking Process:
1. **Room Selection** → User selects rooms and quantities in hotel page
2. **Calculate Total** → System calculates: `(price × quantity) × nights`
3. **Navigate to Booking** → Pass all data via URL parameters:
   ```
   /booking?hotelId=X&hotelName=Y&checkIn=YYYY-MM-DD&checkOut=YYYY-MM-DD
           &rooms=[...]&totalPrice=Z&totalRooms=N&nights=M
   ```
4. **Booking Page** → Display summary with editable dates
5. **Submit Booking** → Send complete data to API:
   ```javascript
   {
     hotel_id: number,
     check_in: string,
     check_out: string,
     customer_name: string,
     customer_phone: string,
     customer_email: string,
     rooms: [{
       room_category_id: number,
       room_type_id: number,
       room_count: number
     }]
   }
   ```

## Example Booking Data

### Before Fix:
```javascript
{
  hotel: 0,              // ❌ Wrong parameter name
  checkin: "",           // ❌ Wrong format
  checkout: "",          // ❌ Wrong format
  rooms: [{
    price: 100000        // ❌ No per-night breakdown
  }]
}
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
{
  hotelId: 123,          // ✅ Correct
  hotelName: "Hotel Name",// ✅ Added
  checkIn: "2024-01-15", // ✅ ISO format
  checkOut: "2024-01-17",// ✅ ISO format
  nights: 2,             // ✅ Calculated
  totalPrice: 400000,    // ✅ price × quantity × nights
  rooms: [{
    room_category_id: 1,
    room_type_id: 2,
    room_count: 2,
    room_name: "Deluxe Room",
    price_per_night: 100000,     // ✅ Per-night price
    total_price: 400000          // ✅ Total with nights
  }]
}
```
